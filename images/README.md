# Example images

The images contained in this directory were generated with `RTXOn`, parsing the 3D scenes you can find in the [examples](https://github.com/grhvaring/RTXOn/tree/master/examples) directory.

As you might notice, they are pretty high-res, so do not expect to replicate them in a short amount of time if you are running `RTXOn` on a laptop.

In fact, each one of them was generated using parallel computing, and still they took several hours to render!

With that said, we hope you enjoy the viewing and have a great day !
